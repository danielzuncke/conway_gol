# Conway's game of life

## Python 3 packages

* cursor
* numpy
* opencv-python

## TODO's

* might need to do in batches so list with matrices doesn't get too long
* def iterate: multiline reading and multithreading for faster evaluation
* pause on keyhit, enter menu
* move output to seperate folder
* menu with ability to:
  * save and load matrix
  * import matrix from png
  * continue simulation (for n iterations)
